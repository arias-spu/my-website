<h1>In this page we will do some tests with CSS</h1>
<p>I can tell you that one of the most interesting days of my life was the day that I was
    selected to participate in a PhD program, and less than 6 hours later I was announced
    that I was going to be a dad.</p>
<p class="delta">Thinking it over, I made the right decision, I declined to participate in
    the PhD program and stayed home to see my family grow.</p>
<p>That was around 2006, a lot has happened!</p>
<p class="delta red">This should be an interesting combination of delta and red</p>
<p class="red delta">How about the other way?</p>
<p>And yet another paragraph to check what this is going to look
    <span class="red">like</span>. Seems like delta can only be used on p tags! can </p>
